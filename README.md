Welcome to Disnet! The game is simple: you are assigned a Disney World restaurant at random, but you cannot see it. However, you can press a button to see menu items from the restaurant. The goal of the game is to determine the restaurant using as few guesses and as few menu items as possible. 

This game is hard, even for Disney lovers! The website was created for my fiancee, who is an avid Disney world lover (addict). Have fun!
